/// \brief View base class.
///
/// Dasher views render the tree of Dasher nodes onto a screen.
///
/// Note that we really should aim to avoid having to try and keep
/// multiple pointers to the same object (model etc.) up-to-date at
/// once. We should be able to avoid the need for this just by being
/// sane about passing pointers as arguments to the relevant
/// functions, for example we could pass a pointer to the canvas every
/// time we call the render routine, rather than worrying about
/// notifying this object every time it changes. The same logic can be
/// applied in several other places.
///
/// There are really three roles played by CDasherView: providing high
/// level drawing functions, providing a mapping between Dasher
/// co-ordinates and screen co-ordinates and providing a mapping
/// between true and effective Dasher co-ordinates (eg for eyetracking
/// mode). We should probably consider creating separate classes for
/// these.
